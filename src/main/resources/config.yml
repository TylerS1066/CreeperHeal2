# Turbo Mode can help repair larger explosions faster.
# The minimum number of blocks an explosion should involve before turbo mode is activated

# Turbo type lets you determine if turbo replaces at a constant

# 0 - constant amount

# Constant Amount Turbo Settings
# The number of blocks to replace in each replacement cycle (For reference, non-turbo is 1)
# Raising this will slightly increase visible lag. Recommended <20

# Percentage Turbo Settings
# Percentage of blocks to replace each cycle (1-100). Recommended <20

# Highest amount of blocks allowed to be replaced in one cycle
# Important to set if you increase turbo-percentage to prevent massive
